# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This is a simple Todo List application built with **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
It includes a drag-and-drop enhancement for reordering items.

Todo list projects are often the first examples used when learning modern frameworks, as they demonstrate **reactivity**, **state management**, and how UI updates respond to state changes.

For the drag-and-drop feature, I used the [vue-draggable-plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-draggable-plus) library.
